Through my professional work, I've built several sites for clients using WordPress.  This includes structuring site elements and using styles to meet the client's needs and wants across a variety of platforms. This also includes adding functionality through custom scripts and by adding and modifying plugins, all while striving to create a robust and user-friendly system.  Below I have listed links with examples of my work.
